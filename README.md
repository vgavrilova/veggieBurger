This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## VeggieBurger

Hello everyone! This is another small web application of mine, which simulates ordering a vegetarian burger!


### Description
The main feature of this app is a dynamic animation of adding particular ingredients to the burger. A user can choose between cheese, salad, pea meat and veggie bacon, whereas a basis which contains burger buns stays the same.


The behaviour of the app depends fully on human interactions! The animation makes it esier for a user to understand which features are blocked right now due to i. e. yet unadded burger ingredients. 


This project was created with React and I continue to update it. In the future updates I will complete this readme with the full information about the app. Till then feel free to ckeck my code and contact me if you have any remarks and/or suggestions!
