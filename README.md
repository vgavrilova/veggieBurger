## VeggieBurger

Hello everyone! This is another small web application of mine, which simulates ordering a vegetarian burger!

### Description

Build your Veggie Burger and order it! An authenticated user can dynamically add cheese, tomatoes, salad, pea meat and veggie bacon to his\*her Burger.

The behaviour of the app depends fully on human interactions! The animation makes it easier for a user to understand which features are blocked right now due to i. e. yet unadded burger ingredients. After ordering, a user is able to see his\*her orders in the profile.
